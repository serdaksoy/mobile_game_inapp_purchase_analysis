# Mobile Game In-App Purchase Analysis (SPSS)

This project analyzes a dataset of over 3,000 observations to understand user behavior and engagement factors leading to high-value (Whale) segments in mobile games.

## 📊 Statistical Methodology
Using **SPSS**, I performed the following tests to validate relationships between demographic variables and spending segments:
* **Chi-Square Test of Independence:** To test the relationship between age, gender, and spending.
* **Odds Ratio & 95% Confidence Intervals:** To determine the risk factors and likelihood of a user becoming a "Whale" (high-spender).
* **Symmetric Measures (Cramer's V, Phi, Somers' d):** To measure the strength and direction of associations between ordinal and nominal variables.

## 🔑 Key Insights
* **Demographics:** Analysis showed no statistically significant relationship (p > 0.05) between age groups and spending segments.
* **Gender Factor:** Males were observed to be 1.67 times more likely to be in the "Whale" segment; however, the confidence interval (0.968 - 2.881) suggests this trend requires more data for significance.
* **Device Influence:** No significant difference was found between Android and iOS users regarding high-value purchase behavior (OR: 1.035).

## 🛠 Tools Used
* **SPSS** (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences)
* **Statistical Reporting**
